# We install using --link to ensure that compiled bytecode and rendered docs are
# placed inside $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, and therefore persisted to other steps in a
# GitHub Actions workflow. Note however that all compilation artifacts for
# dependencies live inside the docker container's racket installation's
# directory, not $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so those will be lost. It's unclear whether
# that's a problem or not. This persistence behavior is the main reason there is
# a single action that installs, builds, and tests a package, instead of
# separate actions for each of those steps.

# We use --drdr to get the same defaults as racket's other standard CI systems,
# including DrDr and the official package catalog build service. Beware that
# this causes stderr output to fail a test, which is not the default behavior of
# `raco test -p mypackage`. So you may see tests pass locally but fail in CI
# because they're printing to stderr and you're not counting that as a failure
# locally. In those cases, prefer counting the stderr output as a legitimate
# failure and switch to using `raco test --drdr` locally.
